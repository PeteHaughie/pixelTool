# ADR-0000

## Title: Example Architecture Decision Record

## Status: Proposed

## Context
This document serves as an example of an Architecture Decision Record (ADR). ADRs are used to capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a software project. They help in documenting the reasoning behind decisions, alternatives considered, and the implications of those decisions.

## Decision
The decision is to adopt the use of ADRs for documenting architectural decisions in our project. This will help in maintaining a clear record of the architectural choices made throughout the project's lifecycle.
